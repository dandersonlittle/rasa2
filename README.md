Solutions to known issues:
Adding to stories.yml instead of just rules.yml.
Implementing standardized coding conventions instead of such repetitive code.
Filling in the test stories. 
Addressing in-line execution warnings.

Minor improvements:
Get marketcap data for coins.
Get recent performance history for coins. 
Implement error handling. 

Big-picture improvements:
It would be sweet to be able to execute trades from the Chatbot. 
It would be sweet to have more access to more on-chain data through the Chatbot. 
It would be sweet to be able to live-query all sorts of coins without hardcoding them. 
Deploy the Chatbot outside of a shell development environment.

Notes on usage:
You’ll need to run “rasa run actions” in a separate terminal window. 
Should work out of the box with “rasa shell”.
